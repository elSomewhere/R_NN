List based
A traditional Neural Network implemented in R. Attempt to imitate an Object-Oriented programming approach (modular functionality) using simple lists only - thereby missing out on any type checking. So far, successfully works on both logical gates as well MNIST imge number classification.

S3-based
A traditional Neural network implemented in R. Object-oriented implementation approach using S3 classes, pass-by-reference using local environments. Unfinished, backpropagation and SGD still missing. But initial test show expected functionality.


Observations:
Programming R in OO is a pain. The entire implementation of OO in R is a mess. S3 vs S4 vs RC vs R6. Pass-by-reference syntax is an even bigger mess if you don't want to rely on external packages. I don't even want to get started on inheritance.

Verdict: I will have to do more Python for projects that require OO. But coming from Java, Python is not very pleasant.
